# V2 Overhaul Build Queue

Source of truth: [`context/V2_PLAN.md`](../context/V2_PLAN.md) — the full approved critique + plan (Appendix A = per-chapter findings, Appendix B = per-chapter rubric, Appendix C = new-chapter specs, plus the Editorial Standard and Convention Decisions used by every content item). **Read the relevant section of that file before starting any item below** — this queue only gives you the item ID and a one-line pointer; the actual spec lives there.

Also read [`context/STYLE_GUIDE.md`](../context/STYLE_GUIDE.md) (Editorial Standard, mechanically applied by every Phase C/N item) and [`context/CURRICULUM.md`](../context/CURRICULUM.md) (target 25-chapter structure) before any content item.

## Protocol

- Process rows **top to bottom**. Phases are ordered by dependency: bug fixes (E) → structural reorg (S) → book-wide conventions (V) → per-chapter deep passes (C) → new chapters (N) → site polish/QA (Q). Do not skip ahead — later items assume earlier ones landed (e.g. every Phase C item assumes S1's renumbering already happened).
- **Builder/critic lifecycle.** The first PENDING row is built and committed as `DRAFT`. An independent critic subagent then reviews it: `DONE` is granted only on approval; a `revise` verdict sends the same DRAFT back for a focused resolution and re-review. `SKIPPED` requires a documented `<!-- skip proposed: ... -->` queue comment and critic approval. Each durable stage is committed locally and never pushed. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full loop.
- **Phase C / N items** (chapter passes) follow the critique→fix→verify protocol in the plan's "Queue item protocol" section: re-read the chapter + its widgets/diagrams, apply Appendix A's baked findings for that chapter plus anything newly found against the Appendix B rubric, apply the Editorial Standard, complete citations, check currency, then `npm run check` and a dev-server spot-check of any changed widget.
- **Phase E / S / V / Q items** are direct spec execution — the plan section for that ID has the concrete instructions.
- Never mark an item DONE with a dirty tree or a failing `npm run check`.
