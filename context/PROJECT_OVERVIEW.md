# darvinyi-textbook — Project Overview

## What This Is

An interactive machine learning textbook deployed as a web application. Think Distill.pub but dark-mode — real depth (derivations, worked examples, closing syntheses) with live interactive widgets embedded as first-class, directed figures throughout.

**Philosophy (V2):** Widgets remain the differentiator, but the book no longer treats them as the *only* teacher. Prose carries real depth; every widget gets a hand-off sentence telling the reader what to try and what to notice, and every widget must faithfully compute what it claims (no fabricated or hard-coded simulations — see [`context/V2_PLAN.md`](V2_PLAN.md) for the audit that drove this change). Full mechanical detail: [`context/STYLE_GUIDE.md`](STYLE_GUIDE.md).

**Target audience:** General CS audience. Assumes programming literacy, linear algebra basics. Does not assume ML background — Chapter 1 (Probability & Information for ML) now exists specifically to teach the probability/information-theory vocabulary the rest of the book relies on.

## Tech Stack

```
Frontend:  React + Vite
Routing:   React Router v7 (one route per chapter, code-split via React.lazy)
Math:      KaTeX (render equations)
Charts:    Custom inline SVG + Canvas for interactive widgets (no D3/Recharts — unused, removed)
Styling:   Inline styles + CSS custom properties (responsive tokens), Tailwind for utility classes
Hosting:   Vercel (static frontend, no backend needed)
No backend, no database, no auth.
```

## Curriculum Summary (25 chapters, 7 parts — V2)

| Part | Chapters | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| I — Foundations | 1-6 | Probability/information theory, statistical learning, neural nets, optimization, training techniques, convolutional networks |
| II — Language & Sequence | 7-10 | Word embeddings & tokenization, RNNs/LSTMs, attention, transformers |
| III — Large Language Models | 11-15 | LLM architectures, reinforcement learning, LLM training & alignment, efficient inference & deployment, multimodal networks |
| IV — Beyond the Transformer | 16-17 | Graph neural networks, state-space models & attention alternatives |
| V — Generative Models | 18-20 | VAEs, GANs & image-to-image, diffusion models |
| VI — Evaluation & Understanding | 21-23 | Datasets & benchmarks, evaluating LLMs & agents, interpretability |
| VII — AI Agents | 24-25 | AI agents, agent harnesses |

The authoritative per-chapter list lives in [CURRICULUM.md](CURRICULUM.md). The V2 migration from the prior 22-chapter structure is complete. [`V2_PLAN.md`](V2_PLAN.md) preserves its rationale, historical mapping, and per-chapter findings.

## Current Status (2026-07)

The V2 overhaul is complete: all 25 chapters are live in the revised reading order, and the queue records the builder/critic history. `context/CURRICULUM.md` and `src/data/chapters.js` are the current sources of truth; older plans and commits retain the previous 22-chapter structure only as history. Q5 removed the obsolete V1 visual curriculum, mock shell, reference-widget prototype, and OpenCode setup guide rather than leaving executable-looking instructions that conflict with V2. Use this overview, `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `CURRICULUM.md`, `V2_PLAN.md`, and the live `src/` components instead.

## Routing

```jsx
// App.jsx — each chapter route is explicitly declared with React.lazy +
// Suspense. chapters.js remains the source of truth for navigation, route
// paths, titles, and home-page metadata; it does not generate this route table.
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/ch/01" element={L(ProbabilityAndInformation)} />
  <Route path="/ch/02" element={L(StatisticalLearning)} />
  {/* ... etc, plus a path="*" 404 route */}
</Routes>
```

## Deployment

- **Platform:** Vercel
- **Deploy trigger:** Push to `main` branch
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Queue gate:** `npm run check` (production build plus Playwright route smoke tests)
- **Output dir:** `dist`
- **No env vars needed** (no backend, no API keys)

## Key Constraints

1. **No real model inference** — widgets simulate behavior mathematically, they don't run actual neural networks. All visualizations are computed analytically or via simple JS math, and must faithfully implement the equations they claim to (see `STYLE_GUIDE.md` — widget fidelity is a hard requirement in V2, not a nice-to-have).
2. **No external data fetching at runtime** — everything is self-contained in the bundle.
3. **KaTeX for math** — not MathJax (too slow). Its CSS and the self-hosted text-font CSS are module imports in `main.jsx`, so Vite fingerprints and emits their production font assets.
4. **No D3/Recharts** — removed as unused dependencies; all interactive viz is custom inline SVG/Canvas.
5. **Mobile is a supported target** — responsive tokens, off-canvas navigation, code-split routes, and the per-widget mobile pass are shipped.
6. **Dark mode only** — no light mode toggle.
